# Elixir

## About the Language

Elixir is a dynamic, functional language that is designed for creating scalable and maintainable applications. It leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems. Elixir is used successfully in web development and the embedded software domain.

## How to Get Started

- **Resources:** The "Getting Started" guide on the official Elixir website is a great way to start learning Elixir. For more in-depth learning, the book "Programming Elixir" by Dave Thomas comes highly recommended.
- **Installation:** You can install Elixir using various package managers depending on your operating system. Detailed installation instructions are available on the official Elixir website.

## Where the Language is Best Applied

Elixir is often used in scenarios where high availability and low latency are required, and it is particularly popular for building scalable web applications:

- **Web Development:** Thanks to the Phoenix Framework, Elixir has become a popular choice for web development, offering robustness and speed.
- **Telecoms and IoT:** Given that it runs on the Erlang VM, which was designed by Ericsson for telecommunications, it's also used in high-availability, low-latency systems and for IoT devices.

## Career Potentials

While Elixir might not have as many job postings as some more established languages, it's in high demand in certain sectors. Furthermore, since the supply of Elixir developers currently doesn't meet the demand, Elixir developers can often command high salaries. Some job roles where Elixir might be beneficial include:

- Backend Developer
- Full Stack Developer (especially in combination with the Phoenix Framework)
- IoT System Developer

With its unique strengths and increasing popularity, Elixir offers interesting opportunities for developers interested in functional programming, high-availability systems, and web development.
