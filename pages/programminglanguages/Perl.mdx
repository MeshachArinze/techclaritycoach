- **Scripting Tasks:** As a scripting language, Perl is commonly used for automating system administration tasks and other routine processes.

## Career Potentials

- While Perl is not as widely used as it once was, there are still job opportunities for Perl developers, particularly in areas such as:
  - System administration
  - Web development
  - Bioinformatics

Perl is a versatile language with a rich history. Despite being overshadowed by newer languages in recent years, Perl remains a practical choice for a variety of text processing and scripting tasks. Learning Perl can be particularly beneficial if you're interested in fields such as system administration or bioinformatics.
