## About the Language

Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a command-line shell/programming language by the GNU Project. It's widely available on various operating systems and is a default command interpreter on most GNU/Linux systems. A shell is a user interface for access to an operating system's services, and shell scripting allows for automating the frequently executed sequences of commands.
